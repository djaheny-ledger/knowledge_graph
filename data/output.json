To continue using your account as usual, please connect your Ledger device to MyLedger via Ledger Live, and proceed to update the app to the latest version. Display bug with DOT accounts A bug in Ledger Live prevents the unbonding of DOT stakes and may hide recent transactions. This issue can be resolved by updating Ledger Live to the latest version. Follow this link to update. Important note regarding Polkadot staking rewards In order to ensure consistent eligibility, it's best to bond more than the minimum. Typically 20 or more DOT above the minimum is enough to ensure consistent eligibility for rewards: Minimum to earn rewards: Minimum to nominate: If you are below the minimum to earn rewards staking from your account, consider joining a Polkadot Nomination Pool and earn rewards on as little as 2.25 DOT. Earn Polkadot (DOT) rewards by bonding assets first, and then nominating validators in Ledger Live. The validators you nominated will use your bonded assets to stake and collect rewards for you. Learn how nomination works > Check the Polkadot wallet page to learn more. Before you start Update Ledger Live through the notification banner or download the latest version. Open Ledger Live, connect your Ledger device to My Ledger and make sure your device is running the latest firmware version and Polkadot (DOT) app. Add a Polkadot (DOT) account. Learn more Bonding your assets To earn DOT staking rewards, you first need to bond your DOTs. Your bonded DOTs can be unbonded at any time but please note it takes 28 days for a DOT balance to fully unbond. On your Polkadot account page, click on the Stake button. Select Bond. If prompted, select where you would like to receive your staking rewards: Available balance: Rewards are credited to your available balance. Bonded balance: Rewards are credited to your bonded balance for compound earning. Note that Ledger Live doesn’t allow you to change the rewards destination later. To change the rewards destination, you can use the third-party wallet Polkadot.js. For detailed instructions, please refer to the Polkadot guide. Enter the amount of DOTs to bond. Then click on Continue.Make sure to keep enough DOT in your available balance to pay transaction fees for other operations such as nominating validators, unbonding, or withdrawing assets. Verify and approve the bonding transaction on your Ledger device. Open the Polkadot app on your device after you've connected and unlocked your device. Press the right button to review all operation details: Staking, Controller, Value, Payee. Press both buttons to Approve and send the operation. Choose Reject to cancel the operation. Once the bonding transaction is confirmed on the Polkadot network, your bonded DOT balance will appear here:Congratulations, you've successfully bonded your DOTs.The next step is to nominate validators. Nominating validators In Polkadot, staking rewards are earned by nominating validators. Validators are private entities that are providing a service to the Polkadot network and earn DOT rewards in return. You can learn more about the roles and responsibilities of a validator here. Every 24 hours (also called an era) a new set of validators is elected to produce blocks and add them to the Polkadot blockchain. The Polkadot network then automatically rewards elected validators for their work by minting new DOT coins. The validators will then share a portion of this reward with DOT holders that are nominating them. This is how rewards are shared across the Polkadot network. To nominate validators: In your Polkadot account, click Nominate. In the Nominate window, select up to 16 validators. Avoid nominating a validator that is oversubscribed. Oversubscribed? A validator is oversubscribed when it receives too many nominations. In Polkadot, only the top 512 nominators of each active validator receive rewards. So if a validator is active but over-subscribed, you must be a part of the 512 highest bonded nominators to receive rewards. If not, you will not receive any rewards. If, however, an active nominee is not over-subscribed, you will receive staking rewards normally. Validators take an arbitrary commission between 0% and 100% on the received rewards. The commission can change over time. Make sure to select nominators who charge less than a 100% commission otherwise you will not receive any staking rewards. Still unsure which validators to choose?

Receiving DOT staking rewards It takes at least 2-3 days after a new nomination to begin receiving DOT staking rewards from validators. DOT rewards are received when an active validator you've nominated claims them for you. Typically, active validators do this daily. Once claimed, rewards will be visible in the 'Latest Operations' section of your Polkadot account. To claim rewards yourself or track pending rewards, please use the third-party wallet Polkadot.js. Unstaking your DOT funds In Polkadot, unstaking a bonded DOT balance is a multi-step process. Each step requires a transaction which you need to confirm on your Ledger device. It takes 3 steps to completely unstake your DOT funds: Your bonded balance must first be chilled. In Ledger Live, chilling is called clearing nominations. Your chilled balance must then be unbonded. Unbonding takes 28 days to complete. Finally, your unbonded balance can be withdrawn back to your available balance. Once your DOT has returned to your available balance, it can be freely traded or transferred to third-party accounts. You can find a detailed breakdown of each step below.

Fiat currencies include the USD, Euro, Sterling Pound, and Chinese Yuan amongst others. What is Fiat Money? Fiat currency refers to a currency that, rather than being backed by gold or silver, is backed by a government. It derives its market value and validity as a medium of exchange from collective societal beliefs. Thus, its intrinsic purchasing power is highly reliant on the government’s decree and collective social conventions; when compromised, the purchasing power declines. It is issued by a government’s treasury, reserves, or central bank, which is responsible for its generation and distribution to the public. This gives the government the power to control supply variations, interest rates, and liquidity. Some examples of fiat money include the USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, and other currencies lawfully accepted by governments as legal tender. What is the Difference Between Fiat Money and Cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrencies differ from fiat money in several ways: Cryptos are not a legal tender of any country, except El Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as its legal tender . Fiat is controlled by the government, while crypto is decentralized, i.e., it doesn’t have a central authority controlling supply variation. Fiat currencies have physical forms such as paper money or coins, while crypto is completely digital. Because cryptocurrencies are decentralized, cross-border transactions are seamless in crypto. On the other hand, fiat currencies transactions require conversions to the corresponding nation’s currency. Crypto enables peer-to-peer transactions, while fiat currencies need a middleman or bank to verify transactions. Crypto transactions are irreversible, in that, crypto payments cannot be reversed once the transactions are confirmed or added within a valid block of the chain, and refunds can only be done by the receiving party. On the other hand, credit card transactions can be canceled by the sending party. Crypto has introduced an alternative to fiat currency as a store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange. It has inspired a number of governments to develop Central Bank Digital Currency , which are digital fiat currencies based on blockchain technology. "}]
